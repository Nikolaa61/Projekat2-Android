# Projekat2-Android
The goal of the project is to develop an application for creating and reviewing events for online meetings with the possibility
sending invitations. The user has the ability to create a new event by defining different ones
parameters, with checking the exact time for different locations of the user to whom he wants to send
invitation (using **Retrofit** on http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone). After adding the desired number of events, the user has the ability to preview all of them
created events (All stored in database using **Room**). There is a possibility to delete for each event within the preview screen.
The user can send an invitation via Viber, SMS, etc ..
